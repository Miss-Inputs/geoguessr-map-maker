## geoguessr-map-maker
Unoriginally named Python library to help make GeoGuessr maps, converting from GeoJSON or similar.

Under construction. If you are reading this it's not even remotely in a usable state because I haven't even taken this out of the readme yet, I just wanted to upload it first.

## TODO
- Command line interface
- Convert GTFS stops to map
- Use as_completed in loops (but ensure we limit connections to streetview)
- Ability to resume from where it was stopped
- iter_coordinates_in_polygon: Handle other CRSes
- (optionally) Discover locations via links
